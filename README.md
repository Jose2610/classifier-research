# Character Matrix Representations and Comparing the Performance/Accuracy of ML Classifiers
For my project four assignment, I decided to program using Python by utilizing Spyder, 
then transitioning to VSCode, to create and observe the training and testing sets from the 
character representations. The main packages used were NumPy, pandas, sklearn, and mlxtend.
Below you will find the visualization of the character matrix representations, as well as the 
results found by observing the effectiveness of the classifiers
