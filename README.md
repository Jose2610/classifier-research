# Character Matrix Representations and Comparing the Performance/Accuracy of ML Classifiers
For my final machine learning and artificial intelligence class assignment, I decided to program using Python by utilizing Spyder, then transitioning to VSCode, to create and observe the training and testing sets from the character representations. The main packages used were NumPy, pandas, sklearn, and mlxtend. Below you will find the visualization of the character matrix representations, as well as the results found by observing the effectiveness of the classifiers.

## Testing Results
To view the full detail of my project, please open the Project 4 PDF to view my findings on how the various classifiers did in recognizing the matrix representations.
